## Session Overview
**Date:** [Session Date]  
**Location:** Saltmere Island - Salt & Anchor Tavern  
**Weather:** Severe storm throughout session  
**Party Level:** 1st Level (All characters)  

## Opening Situation
The party arrived at Saltmere Island after escaping by boat from unknown circumstances. Seeking shelter and contracts, they entered the Salt & Anchor Tavern during the onset of a fierce storm.

**Initial Party Dynamics:**
- Seraphina: Protective adoptive mother, wary but determined
- Dragonboy: Rebellious copper-scaled dragonborn child, eager to help
- Owen: Pragmatic fighter/sorcerer focused on finding paid work

## The Mystery Unveiled
While seeking contracts from tavern keeper Marta, Owen learned of mysterious disappearances plaguing the island:

**Missing Villagers:**
- **Tam:** Young fisherman, Harald's nephew, vanished while checking nets
- **Sera:** Weaver, disappeared while visiting grandmother via cliff path  
- **Tomás:** Lighthouse keeper, found missing with beacon dark and supper still warm

**Key Information Gathered:**
- All three disappeared along the northern coast within half a mile of each other
- Disappearances occurred over past month, regardless of weather conditions
- Sera's shawl found on rocks below cliffs, no other trace
- Local Constable Marwick investigating but making no progress

## The Horror Returns
As the storm intensified, the missing villagers returned - but corrupted beyond recognition:

**The Corrupted Beings:**
- Barnacle-encrusted skin and unnatural movements
- Backwards/twisted head positioning (Tomás)
- Bone-white claws replacing fingernails
- Waterlogged clothing and scent of deep ocean decay
- Unified chanting and hunger for magical energy
- Retained some memories and speech patterns of original victims

## Critical Combat Events

### Dragonboy's Catastrophic Decision
**Action:** Opened tavern door and shouted for "everyone to come for safety"
**Rolls:** Natural 20 (door opening), Natural 1 (concentration), Natural 1 (detection)
**Consequences:** 
- Alerted every threat on the island to their location
- Broke his Shape Water illusions, revealing their position
- Drew the three corrupted villagers directly to the tavern

### The Unprecedented Transformation
**Trigger:** Extreme danger as corrupted Tomás approached
**Attempt:** Dragonboy tried to Wild Shape into an owlbear (far beyond 1st level capabilities)
**Roll:** Natural 20 - Critical Success
**Result:** Achieved impossible **Copper-Scaled Owlbear** transformation
- Large size, 30 temporary HP, natural armor
- Maintained draconic breath weapon (acid cone)
- Hybrid creature combining owlbear strength with draconic magic
