# Session 003: The Final Compact

## Session Overview
**Date:** [Session Date]  
**Location:** Saltmere Island - Harbor and Founders' Cave  
**Weather:** Storm breaking, dawn sunlight emerging  
**Party Level:** 2nd Level throughout  
**Session Type:** Shorter resolution session  
**Note:** Aleron absent initially, dramatic return at climax  

## Opening Situation
Dawn breaks over the devastated Salt & Anchor Tavern. The party, exhausted from defeating the Hunger of the Depths, faces the immediate aftermath. Dragonboy experiences disturbing visions while consuming raw fish, revealing a terrible truth: the seven-soul compact isn't truly broken, merely stretched.

**Initial Party Status:**
- Dragonboy: Exhausted, experiencing prophetic visions and strange hunger
- Seraphina: Worried about her son, contemplating village needs
- Owen: Pragmatic, investigating the harbor situation
- Aleron: Departed at dawn to report to his Order

## The Compound Interest Crisis

### Dragonboy's Prophetic Vision
While eating raw fish (failing a DC 12 Wisdom save), Dragonboy experiences a profound vision:
- Seven lights in darkness: 4 bright (saved villagers), 3 dark (the dead)
- Threads still connecting all seven to something vast below
- Revelation: "The connection isn't completely broken"

### The Mass Entrancement
Investigation at the harbor reveals a catastrophic escalation:
- Eerie singing beneath the waves
- Villagers becoming entranced, marching toward the sea
- Chanting: "Seven given, seven taken. The depths remember. The compact holds."

**The Terrible Mathematics:**
- Saltmere has missed 43 seven-year cycles
- The Hunger demands compound interest: 7 × 7 × 43
- The entire village is being called as payment

## The Founders' Cave Discovery

### Owen's Critical Mission
While chaos erupts at the harbor, Owen rushes to the Founders' Cave beneath the lighthouse, discovering the original compact:

**The Full Contract Revealed:**
- The "Lesser Hunger" has been protecting against a "Greater Hunger"
- Seven souls every seven years kept the Lesser Hunger strong enough to guard
- Breaking the pattern weakened this protection
- **Cessation Clause**: 49 volunteers must die at the stone to seal both Hungers forever

### The Greater Horror
The party's perception of the crisis transforms:
- The Hunger they fought was just a guardian/parasite
- Beneath it lies something incomprehensibly vast
- The seven-soul compact was PROTECTING the coast, not enslaving it

## The Final Battle for Saltmere

### Desperate Measures
**Dragonboy's Heroic Effort:**
- Maintains Shape Water to distract 25 entranced villagers
- Exhausts himself holding the spell (failed Con save)
- Suffers psychic backlash when concentration breaks

**Seraphina's Moment of Power:**
- Protecting entranced children from water tentacles
- Hellish Rebuke enhanced by maternal fury
- Silver flames reveal the Greater Hunger beneath

**Owen's Leadership:**
- Rallies volunteers for the cessation ritual
- Convinces villagers to sacrifice for the greater good
- Organizes the race to the cave

### The Race Against Time
- 48 volunteers gathered, need 49
- Tam volunteers as the 49th - "the bridge between living and taken"
- The Greater Hunger's eye opens, tentacles the size of streets emerge
- Desperate flight to the Founders' Cave

## The Climax

### Aleron's Divine Intervention
At the crucial moment, Aleron appears on the clifftop like "Gandalf on the hill," channeling divine light beyond his level to distract the Greater Hunger, buying precious time for the ritual.

### The Ritual of Sacrifice
- 49 volunteers form a circle around the ancient pedestal
- Speak in unison: "We return what was taken. We seal what was broken. Our lives for all lives. The Hungers sleep eternal."
- Volunteers transform into eternal guardians of light

### The Final Strike
**Dragonboy's Impossible Transformation:**
- Despite exhaustion, achieves owlbear form again
- Seraphina and Owen hurl him at the Greater Hunger's tentacle
- The Lesser Hunger uses its last strength to amplify the throw
- 23 damage breaks the Greater Hunger's interference

## Resolution

### The New Compact
- 49 volunteers become eternal guardians
- Both Hungers sealed forever
- Golden chains of light drag the Greater Hunger to eternal slumber
- Saltmere and all coastal lands saved

### Immediate Aftermath
- Tam's light pulses in farewell
- The bronze plaque reads: "Here rest forty-nine heroes. They chose to guard. Remember them."
- Sunlight breaks through for the first time in days
- Aleron's fate uncertain after cliff collapse

### Character Development Moments

**Dragonboy:**
- Prophetic abilities manifesting strongly
- Two impossible transformations showing unprecedented power
- Growing connection to supernatural forces
- Physical toll of magical exertion

**Seraphina:**
- Maternal protection extending to entire village
- Warlock powers responding to emotional extremity

## Losses and Gains
